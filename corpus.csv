|Report: Our High Schools May Not Adequately Prepare Dropouts For Unemployment|,| WASHINGTON, DCA Department of Labor report released Monday finds that America's high schools are not sufficiently preparing emerging dropouts for the demands of unemployment|,|   Future jobless Americans between classes at Oakes High School In a letter introducing the report, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao explained that schools routinely fail to impart dropouts with the critical lying- and sitting-around skills they need to thrive in today's jobless market "Our public high schools place too much focus on preparing kids for professional careers," Chao said "This waste of resources leaves our dropouts, the majority of whom have no chance of ever finding a job, wholly unprepared to sleep till 1 pm, or watch daytime television while eating ramen noodles out of an upturned Frisbee" According to the study, America's weakest academic performers also drop out of high school without ever having learned to steal beer money from their housemates' change jars or wash their hair with bar soap "This oversight cannot continue if our kids are to become unproductive citizens," Chao said "The future dregs of society are not being served" Despite massive cuts in recent decades, some remnants of math and science instruction continue to plague many school districts These courses, Chao argued, waste valuable time and money Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings defended the nation's public-school system "Educators do a lot to ensure that the most hopeless students slip through the cracks," Spellings said "Arbitrary rules, irregularly enforced discipline, and pointless paperwork are just the first things that come to mind"   [pagebreak]  She added: "Easy grading encourages students to be sloppy and late handing in homeworka skill that makes future deadbeats very competitive in stonewalling landlords and bill collectors" Chao said educators need to think outside the classroom and give kids some real off-the-job experience  "Increasing suspensions and expulsions is a good start," Chao said "Furthermore, scoliosis exams should be made more routine, so students learn to adapt to the all-underwear wardrobe typical of the non-working class" Chao also suggested that schools hold more blood drives, which would prepare dropouts for visits to their local blood-plasma donation centers for quick and easy cash  Some educators say the report paints too bleak a picture of schools' efforts to instill students with a lack of ambition "We are doing a terrible, terrible job," said James Dunham, the principal of HS 445 in New York "We literally could not be doing any worse" Dunham highlighted the fact that the hallways of his school are lined with vending machines that sell nothing but unhealthy snack products such as soda and potato chips, both of which acclimate students to the diet of a jobless lowlife Susan French, a spokesperson for the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, said educators are superb role models for the unemployed dropouts of tomorrow Said French: "Students spend seven hours a day surrounded by adults who despise their low-paying jobs If the critics out there know a better way to discourage a young person from entering the work force, I'd like to see it" |
|Suicide Bomber Killed En Route By Car Bomb|,| BAGHDADTerrorist cells in Baghdad are in mourning for suicide bomber Ahmed al-Khalaf, 19, who was killed by a car bomb Monday, 200 yards from an Iraqi police station, his intended target|,|   Sources within the insurgency said al-Khalaf was "on his way to becoming a glorious martyr" when he was struck down by the car-bomb explosion Twenty-three other civilians were also killed  "What kind of God allows the death of people who are on their way to kill innocent people?" insurgent leader Abdulwahid al-Tomizie said "On the one hand, I am elated that the car-bomb explosion was successful, but the loss of the suicide bomber is a tragedy, as is the survival of all the innocent people he might have killed"  According to al-Tomizie, al-Khalaf could have killed as many as 40 innocent people, had his life not been cut short  "It is tragic that al-Khalaf died seven minutes sooner than he intended," said Hassan Abdul Aziz, leader of a local cabal of Sunni separatists "To think that he was just yards from his intended target Our thoughts and prayers are with his terrorist cell" No insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for the car bomb, although as many as 18 separate insurgency factions have vowed to carry on the fight in al-Khalaf's memory In the past week, over 170 Iraqi citizens and US troops have died in terrorist or insurgent attacks, but al-Khalaf's death marks the first time a terrorist has been killed by another terrorist while on a different terrorist mission   Iraqis mourn the car-bombing death of suicide bomber al-Khalaf Terrorist leaders have called the incident a "wake-up call" "No one likes to see a senseless waste of a willingness to take human life," said al-Qaeda operative Salih al-Shimiri, in a videotaped message aired on Al-Jazeera Monday evening "However, there are worse problems than having too many suicide bombers on our streets" Insurgent leaders met Monday to draft new rules to prevent bombing mix-ups like the one that killed al-Khalaf One proposal would limit suicide bombings to odd hours, car bombings to even Another designates "Car Bomb Only" traffic lanes to help terrorists get to their bombing locations more quickly and efficiently "I had a man last week get stuck in traffic while driving a car bomb to the Mendi Temple," al-Shimiri said "When he arrived, he found it already on fire We don't fill the cars up with enough gas to make two-way trips, so he was forced to blow up a nearby disco This is madness" Al-Shimiri added: "We all have the same goal herethe killing of innocent civilians Let's stop working at cross purposes" Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr believes all insurgents must find direction in their extreme fundamentalist faith "When I close my eyes, all I can see are the faces of all the innocents al-Khalaf will never get a chance to kill It is a sad day, but we must not let it shake our faith in the wrath of Allah" |
|White House Denies Existence Of Karl Rove|,| WASHINGTON, DCThe White House denied rumors of wrongdoing by anyone named Karl Rove Monday, saying the alleged deputy chief of staff does not exist|,|   White House press secretary Scott McClellan "To my knowledge, no one by the name of Karl Rove works for this president, his staff, or for that matter, anyone on earth, since he is not a real person," White House press secretary Scott McClellan told reporters Monday Despite White House denials, allegations have surfaced in recent weeks that Karl Rove is the man who leaked covert CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity to the press He is rumored to be President Bush's senior advisor, chief political strategist, architect of the president's 2000 and 2004 election victories, and the current deputy White House chief of staff, as well as a frequent guest on televised political talk shows "None of these allegations are supported by the facts," McClellan said "The opponents of this administration have created a mythical figure in order to discredit the president All they have done is divert attention from the important work at handthe war in Iraq and the war on terror In doing so, they have dishonored the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform" "This time," he added, "the Democrats have gone too far" According to fringe journalist Lou Dubose, author of Boy Genius: Karl Rove, The Brains Behind The Remarkable Political Triumph Of George W Bush, Rove was born Dec 25, 1950 in Denver, CO Dubose alleges that Rove lived in Colorado with his family until 1963, when he moved to Salt Lake City, UT According to Dubose, the shadowy figure entered politics in college, quickly moving through the ranks to become the chairman of the College Republican National Committee at age 22  [pagebreak]  The White House has called such reports "nonsense"   This rare photo depicts the man Bush Administration critics are calling "Karl Rove" McClellan reiterated his denial of Karl Rove's existence 33 times during the press conference When pressed, he distributed a list of "real, actual political figures about whom I'd be happy to comment" The list included only President George W Bush and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y Mineta Rumors of the figure's existence were given a boost early this month when, as part of the official investigation into the CIA leak, a Time magazine reporter named Rove as the source of the leak "This is a very clever fiction concocted by those on the other side of the aisle,"  Vice President Dick Cheney said "It's preposterous at its core" The phantom advisor has come under heavy fire in recent weeks from critics of the administration, who say he should be fired for his role in the scandal President Bush has pledged that anyone in his administration found to be involved in the CIA leak will be dismissed "There is no such organization as the CIA," McClellan said "This is tinfoil-hat stuff" Initially demanding that the alleged Rove be fired, Democrats say they are now focusing their efforts on proving the figure's existence  "I believe this deputy White House chief of staff is real, despite White House claims to the contrary," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said "But to disprove this wild ghost story, we must begin an exhaustive fact-finding mission, for which I pledge all the time and resources of the entire Democratic party" |
|First-Time Novelist Constantly Asking Wife What It's Like To Be A Woman|,| SAN JOSE, CAClaims adjuster and novice author John Kitner is "constantly" asking what it's like to be a woman, reports his wife Becky|,|   Amateur novelist John Kitner struggles to write from a woman's perspective "It never lets up," Becky said "Today he asked, 'If a woman were running from a burning building, what would she be thinking about?' And I don't know how to answer that I'd be thinking about getting away from the building, I think" The questions began when Kitner first started writing his crime thriller, Low Jack, in December of 2004 At the time, he reportedly asked occasional questions ranging from, "Would a woman want to be romanced by 22-year-old wannabe confidence man Ronnie Hodges?" to, "How would a woman feel if she were hammering a guy on the head with a briefcase full of money?" "I didn't mind the questions at first," Becky said "I was happy to help out" But in recent weeks, the level of questioning has become what Becky called "really annoying" Becky said when the two were at the grocery store Sunday night, Kitner began staring at her as she looked over the frozen-foods section According to Becky, Kitner asked, "What type of food would a woman try to eat if she were trapped in a walk-in freezer? How about a piece of liver? Would that be it? If I were a woman, I think that would be just perfect But I don't know You tell me, Becky" Becky said her husband's questions are typically followed by him producing a small notebook and ball-point pen "I really don't like when he whips out the notebook and clicks the pen and stares at me," Becky said According to Kitner, Becky has been "a great resource" in his novel writing  [pagebreak]  "Becky is an indispensable tool in my writer's tool chest," Kitner said "I feel like, with her, I'm able to get under Vivian's skin"  Kitner referred to his heroine, Vivian Drake, a 26-year-old ingenue who is "thrust into a steamy underworld of intrigue and danger in Low Jack" Best-selling writer Tom Clancy, author of Without Remorse, said Kitner is lucky to have Becky as a source of reference "I worked alone in my study for years on The Bear And The Dragon before I realized my female character Lian Ming was dead on the page," Clancy said "If only I'd had someone like Becky around to answer some questions It might have helped me figure out how women think" Clancy said he hopes Kitner can unlock the mystery of writing female characters, something no male novelist has ever been able to do Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and literary critic John Updike agrees "Someone should have thought of asking these questions earlier," Updike said "If only Tolstoy had thought of this, Anna Karenina might have been a more memorable novel" Updike added: "John Kitner's quest is a part of a larger one: how to write a character who is different from yourself If he can find the magic key to this age-old puzzle, he will usher in a renaissance in human literature For the first time, crime novelists will be able to write convincingly about murderers, even if they are not murderers themselves Non-spies will be able to write about spies In this new type of literature, there will actually  be characters who are something other than novelists Imagine the possibilities" Kitner shares these high hopes for his work, but his wife, who has had an opportunity to read some of his early drafts, said it "still needs a lot of work" |
|U.N. Orders Wonka To Submit To Chocolate Factory Inspections|,| UNITED NATIONS—Responding to pressure from the international community, the U|,|N ordered enigmatic candy maker William "Willy" Wonka to submit to chocolate-factory inspections Monday   The enigmatic, elusive despot  "For years, Wonka has hidden the ominous doings of his research and development facility from the outside world," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said "Given the reports of child disappearances, technological advances in glass-elevator transport, and Wonka-run Oompa-Loompa forced-labor camps, the time has come to put an end to three decades of secrecy in the Wonka Empire" The chocolate-making capabilities of Wonka's heavily fortified compound have long been a source of speculation Wonka, defying international calls for full disclosure, has maintained his silence regarding his factory's suspected capacity to manufacture confections of mass deliciousness Secretary of State Colin Powell praised the UN announcement "No more will this sinister figure be free to pursue his nefarious endeavors without fear of reprisal, protected by loopholes in international candy-making law," Powell said "With this ruling, the UN has issued the global community a 'golden ticket' to draw back the curtain behind which this mysterious confectioner hides"     According to CIA psychological profilers, Wonka has retreated from the outside world entirely, withdrawing into "a world of pure imagination" An anonymous tinker stationed near the infamous, long-locked Wonka factory gate corroborated the claim, saying, "Nobody ever goes in, nobody ever comes out" Rival candy makers, long worried that Wonka's advanced capabilities have created an imbalance of power within the volatile global chocolate marketplace, also applauded the UN move "Wonka exerts a powerful psychological grip over the world's children," said Arthur Slugworth, president of Slugworth Confections "They are devoted to him with a loyalty that borders on the fanatical, eagerly lapping up Scrumdiddlyumptious Bars by the millions at his command But when we found evidence that Wonka was developing so-called 'everlasting gobstopper' technology—'the mother of all gobstoppers'—we knew it was time to act" To date, all efforts to peer inside the Wonka inner sanctum have met with failure Armies of legal experts retained by Wonka have kept visitors to his chocolate-making facilities effectively gagged with elaborate non-disclosure agreements His in-house staff of high-contrast Technicolor dwarves carefully monitors what information flows in or out of the heavily guarded compound And the few scraps of information that have come to light—vague reports of terrifying river-barge rides, razor-sharp ceiling fans, and human-sized pneumatic tubes of indeterminate purpose—have been obscured by layers of darkly comic, psychedelic symbolism, making them virtually impossible to interpret "Wonka has shown himself to be a man who cannot be trusted," Annan said "Whether misrepresenting himself as a limping cripple, only to drop at the last moment into an agile somersault, or exploiting the deepest and most personal character flaws of misbehaving children, Wonka has been a man of shifty, undetermined motives and baffling ends He must be stopped"   A CIA surveillance image of suspicious activity within the Wonka compound  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, a longtime advocate of regime change in the Wonka Empire, is urging President Bush to consider military intervention should Wonka refuse to cooperate "The world can no longer turn a blind eye to Wonka's deception and misdirection," Rumsfeld said "Without full inspections, there's no earthly way of knowing which direction Wonka's going Not a speck of light is showing, so the danger must be growing And he's certainly not showing any signs that he is slowing Are the fires of Hell a-glowing? Is the grisly reaper mowing? Who can provide the world with the answer to these pressing questions?" "The candy man can," Rumsfeld added grimly Bush said he is leaning toward the use of force, undeterred by the prospect of the candy maker using his rumored "Wonkavision" technology to turn would-be attackers into millions of tiny pieces, beaming them through the air and shrinking them to tiny, dollhouse-accessory size "We are talking about a man who is able to take a rainbow and cover it with dew," Bush told reporters during a press conference Monday "Who knows what else he is capable of? Left to his own devices, he could, in a worst-case scenario, make the world taste very bad, indeed" |
|Migrant Worker Family Thrilled To See Selves On Cover Of The Economist|,| SAN CARLOS, TX—A family of Mexican migrant workers was thrilled to find its picture on the cover of the Jan|,| 25 issue of The Economist, vegetable farmhand, factory laborer, and fruit picker Luis Moreno reported Monday   The issue that made the Morenos famous "Imagine my surprise when I walked past the newsstand and saw my own face on the cover of a magazine—a very respected international publication, no less," said Moreno, 34, speaking with the aid of a translator "I couldn't believe it I opened the magazine and there we were again, right there under the headline, 'Hard Harvest: The Enduring Plight Of Migrant Workers In America' I ran to my wife with a copy of the issue as fast as I could and said, 'Hey, Rosa, we're famous!" Ever since losing his job as a mechanic's assistant in Mexico City four years ago, Moreno, his wife Rosa, and their three young sons have roamed the American South and Midwest in search of seasonal labor "Judging by the scenery and the size of little Esteban, I am guessing the photo was taken in north Texas, shortly after the October harvest," Moreno said "We were relocating from the lower Rio Grande valley to Iowa, where I can usually find winter work in the slaughterhouses or the pork-processing plants How lucky we were to be on that particular road that day!" Continued Moreno: "I do not specifically remember anyone taking my picture, but that is not surprising if we were in the middle of traveling It gets very tiring, of course, and sometimes you do not pay attention to distractions" Moreno praised The Economist's photo editor for choosing the cover image "The clothes we were wearing created a very interesting pastiche of colors, which is probably why he chose that particular shot," Moreno said "Also, the photographer caught us at a moment when our expressions powerfully conveyed the great weariness we were feeling" The seven-page cover story, which featured a second photo of the Moreno family inside the magazine, focused on George W Bush and Mexican president Vicente Fox's long-running dispute over migrant workers and the legalization of undocumented Mexicans in the US "I was so excited," Moreno said "I had a little money saved, enough for three copies I sent one home to Mexico to my grandmother, I put one away to keep nice, and the other I used to show all of my friends" Within hours of the issue hitting newsstands, Moreno said he began hearing from friends, coworkers, and relatives   Guillermo Nunez (left), Luis Moreno's best friend, shows off the issue "I call home to my mother in Oaxaca whenever I can, just to make sure everyone is okay, especially our little Juanita, who is too young to travel," Moreno said "The first thing she says to me is, 'Your cousin Carlos called to say he saw you in The Economist He says to call him right away My son, the celebrity!'" Rosa said the cover story has made her and the rest of the Moreno clan the talk of the migrant-worker community "It's amazing how many people have seen it," Rosa said "We were passing through Sebastian on the way to Progreso, and we stopped to visit some old friends from Mexico City who found work in a tannery The first thing out of everyone's mouth was, 'Here comes the cover girl!' You should have seen me blush" "Our friend Miguel and his wife were teasing us, calling us 'undocumented migrants' like they did in the story," Rosa added, "but it was all in good fun" Moreno, who read the article with the help of a translator, said he felt The Economist's assessment of migrant workers and their plight was "evenhanded and intelligent" "Basically, the author of the article said migrant workers are net contributors to the economy of a country because they are disproportionately of working age, and the receiving country has not had to pay for their education," Moreno said "And they pointed out that migration does not seem to increase unemployment among the native-born" "To be fair, it did say it may reduce their pay," Rosa said "But I agree with Luis that it certainly was a fairer look at the subject than I have come to expect" "I've been treated badly by many people throughout my life," added Rosa, lowering her eyes to the floor Though he does not expect to appear on another magazine cover any time soon, Moreno expressed hope that one day his family will have the luck to be interviewed by a PhD candidate conducting research in one of the seasonal worker camps "It's amazing what a complex system of social ties we itinerant workers maintain, considering that we are always in motion and have only limited access to modern communications," Moreno said "Don't you think that would make a fascinating subject for a dissertation?"  |
|Debate Team State Finalists Live It Up In Super 8 Hot Tub|,| OSHKOSH, WI—The 16 members of the Abbotsford High School debate team enjoyed a night of revelry in the hot tub of an Oshkosh Super 8 motel Sunday, celebrating their second-place finish in the Wisconsin High School Forensic Association state competition|,|    Members of the Abbotsford High School debate team get psyched for a wild night at the Super 8 "This is it, guys," said team captain Ethan Howe, sinking back into the bubbling water and raising a can of Orange Slice high into the air "This is what we've been working so hard for all year!"  On Jan 11, the Abbotsford debate team qualified for the state competition, "killing" at the district level The following day, Abbotsford Forensics Club advisor Sharon Knauf made lodging accommodations for the students in Oshkosh for the WHSFA Four-Speaker State Debate Tournament, held at 8 pm Sunday at University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh  "For years, whenever we went to state, I always booked the Oshkosh Econolodge," said Knauf, 53, who has coached forensics for 18 years "A few years ago, though, they opened up this Super 8 right off Hwy 41, and I really like it better: There's no problem parking the bus, and it's quite a ways to downtown, so no one is tempted to try to sneak out"  Super 8 #2692 boasts an indoor heated pool and whirlpool, free HBO and ESPN, and a vending area with candy, chips, soda, and an ice machine On weekends, the motel also offers a continental breakfast from 6 to 10 am  "This place rocks," said Howe, a white towel draped around his neck as he swaggered to the button that restarts the whirlpool "We are livin' it up"  Knauf reserved nine adjoining rooms on the east wing of the second floor, assigning two students to each room and giving herself a single The rooms were situated near the vending area, a spot frequented by the high-spirited students throughout the night  "We took up a collection in an ice bucket—I put in, like, seven dollars—and we brought a bunch of snacks back to Party Central [Room 233]," Howe said "Jim [Gamble] even had a CD player, which he technically wasn't allowed to bring Shhh"  The mischief, sources report, was not limited to boom-box smuggling Student and allergy sufferer John Greipentrog, claiming to be in desperate need of Benadryl, obtained Knauf's permission to leave the motel to walk to the Amoco station down the road  "I was lying," said Greipentrog, who actually made a "supply run" for food to add to the already copious amounts left over from the celebratory dinner at Olive Garden "I had my Allegra with me Of course, I was way nervous about lying to a teacher, but the rest of the team convinced me to live on the edge for once"  By 7 pm, the motel's whirlpool had become the center of activity Nearly all the students convened at the 10-person hot tub, enjoying the company of their fellow honor students in pampered luxury  "I forgot my swimsuit, but I just wore shorts and a T-shirt—right in the pool!" junior Denise Neumann said "We were singing our school song, but we changed the words to make fun of the a-holes on the football team"  The combination of the wet bodies, caffeine, and general spirit of revelry even resulted in some intra-squad flirting  "Eric [Yetter] is so funny," sophomore Kim Ault said "He was pretending to fall asleep, and he'd sink down into the water and act like he was dead Then he got my hair all wet, even though I wasn't going to put it in the water"  Later that night, Yetter and Ault disobeyed the "no co-ed room activity" rule, professing merely to be "sharing passages from their Advanced English 11 journals"  "I don't know what went on, but Eric is, like, Kim's man now," said Wendy Druyan, Ault's roommate "We kept knocking on the door and calling their phone until they took it off the hook Then we went in Denise's room next door and banged on the wall"  The only student who did not participate in the tomfoolery was Jay Gawlikoski, who spent the night in his room  "If we get in trouble, it could go on our permanent record and colleges would see that," said Gawlikoski, two-time recipient of Knauf's Most Valuable Debater award "I'd be more than up for some charades or maybe a game of euchre, but I really have no interest in doing something stupid that'd hurt my chances of getting into Northwestern"  According to anonymous sources, Gawlikoski is a "puss" and "just mad because everyone teased him for bringing a huge suitcase for an overnight stay" The unnamed student also claimed that Gawlikoski actually phoned his mother to tell her the results of his competition and was in bed by 10 pm  Unlike Gawlikoski, the other students were more than ready to party late into the night The last to turn in, sneaking back to their respective rooms at 4 am, were Randy Lund and Tim Farber, a pair of juniors who earlier in the day went head to head against the co-captains of the vaunted Eau Claire Memorial High School squad  "Yes, we were ultimately vanquished, but our 11-4 record is nothing to sneeze at, and we made some very persuasive arguments on the WHSFA debate topic, Weapons Of Mass Destruction," Farber said " What's more, with just two graduating seniors on the entire squad, the Abbotsford debate team will be a force to be reckoned with next year We had more than enough reason to make merry this eve"   |
|5 Rules To Survive Falling Skies|,| |,||
|New Economy Wistfully Recalled As Tiny Dot-Com Promotional Object Found In Drawer|,| SAN FRANCISCO—The "New Economy"—the Internet-driven business landscape once predicted to make "bricks and mortar" retailers obsolete—was wistfully recalled Monday, when a small dot-com promotional item was discovered in the junk drawer of former dot-commer Eric Noyce|,|   The antHeadcom promotional thingy Noyce, 28, an associate vice-president of business development for Petscom from August 1998 to December 2000, came across a small gadget emblazoned with "antHeadcom" while searching for a corkscrew to open a $3 bottle of wine "Holy shit, check this out," said the minimum-wage-earning Noyce as he examined the slick-looking promotional doohickey "antHeadcom I think I remember getting this It was in a goodie bag I got at some launch party antHead, antHead What did they do again?" According to roommate Bryan Bollinger, a former Floozcom tech-support supervisor and current delivery driver for Angelo's Pizza, Noyce became sentimental and introspective while gazing at the useless but expensively manufactured trinket "He had this far-away look in his eyes, like he'd been transported back to a more innocent, simpler time," Bollinger said "I guess we can all relate to that feeling" Bollinger, who has bounced between unemployment and under-employment for two and a half years, then returned to watching TV as Noyce continued to wax nostalgic "Wait a minute," Noyce said "I remember this antHead thingy having some sort of button that would light up different colors every time you squeezed it Shit, how much do you think something like this would cost to make? Those guys must have spent a fortune on these It doesn't really do anything, but I remember pulling it out of my launch-party gift bag, thinking it was kind of cool Sort of" Noyce then tried to squeeze the object to see if it would still light up It did not Like thousands of other dot-com promotional doodads produced from the mid-'90s until the New Economy bubble burst in the winter of 2000-01, the object was created as a means of "raising awareness and generating excitement about the brand" Handed out by the thousands at antHeadcom's extravagant launch party in July 1999, it soon found its way into Noyce's bedroom junk drawer, along with numerous other equally functionless giveaways from the time, including a FilmZonecom miniature director's chair, a Boocom yo-yo, and a Kozmocom glow-in-the-dark floppy flyer "Wait, I got it!" said Noyce, snapping out of his silence "antHead! They had this huge pre-launch ad campaign in alternative weeklies across the country, with those mysterious 'teaser' ads that showed the ant-face logo with just the words 'antHead Is Coming' When they finally launched, the party was held in five cities simultaneously, each one simulcast to the others via live satellite feed on huge video-projection screens I'm pretty sure Douglas Coupland was the celebrity host" Added Noyce: "I think the antHead site offered either original Shockwave-animated programming, live music webcasts, or both Or neither" Though neither Noyce nor anyone else in the US can remember, antHeadcom went public in August 1999, making its debut on NASDAQ at $17 a share By April 2000, the stock had risen to a whopping $114 per share, with a market cap of $81 billion As part of their compensation packages, Noyce and his fellow dot-com employees were often issued stock options, which have come to be known in the financial world as "pretend Internet money" This pretend money, now estimated to be of slightly less value than the multi-colored paper bills used in Monopoly, was considered extremely valuable at the time A great deal of this imaginary wealth was actually used to purchase Time Warner, one of the largest media conglomerates in the world "I remember the food at the antHead launch was great," Noyce said "They had ceviche and grilled shrimp on skewers and these really great mini-fajita hors d'oeuvres I just wish I could remember more about the company" According to financial analysts, for many people Noyce's age, the New Economy boom was a mythic, idyllic time in American history "Prosperity seemed to hang from tree boughs like ripe fruit," said Forbes senior writer Peter Kafka, author of What The F@%* Happened?!?: The New Economy—Fall '97 To Winter 2K "A revolutionary cyber-transformation of global culture and commerce seemed only 12 to 18 months away, and it felt like nothing could ever go wrong It was a time of innocence, idealism, and magic" "There we all were, straight out of college with zero real-world work experience, making $500,000 a year for, like, 12 weeks before transitioning into long periods of unemployment," Bollinger said "Man, those were great weeks" "Reminiscing about those days must be an emotional experience for Noyce," Kafka said "Those antHead people had practically unlimited venture-capital start-up funds He probably can't help but wonder about all the things that money could have bought, like a washing machine so he wouldn't have to haul his laundry all the way down to the basement of his rathole apartment complex every time he needed to wash his Arby's uniform"  |
|Skeptic Pitied|,| FAYETTEVILLE, AR—Craig Schaffner, 46, a Fayetteville-area computer consultant, has earned the pity of friends and acquaintances for his tragic reluctance to embrace the unverifiable, sources reported Monday|,|   The tragically skeptical Schaffner "I honestly feel sorry for the guy," said neighbor Michael Eddy, 54, a born-again Christian "To live in this world not believing in a higher power, doubting that Christ died for our sins—that's such a sad, cynical way to live I don't know how he gets through his day" Coworker Donald Cobb, who spends roughly 20 percent of his annual income on telephone psychics and tarot-card readings, similarly extended his compassion for Schaffner "Craig is a really great guy," Cobb said "It's just too bad he's chosen to cut himself off from the world of the paranormal, restricting himself to the limited universe of what can be seen and heard and verified through empirical evidence" Also feeling pity for Schaffner is his former girlfriend Aimee Brand, a holistic and homeopathic healer who earns a living selling tonics and medicines diluted to one molecule per gallon in the belief that the water "remembers" the curative properties of the medication "Don't get me wrong—logic and reason have their place," Brand said "But Craig fails to recognize the danger of going too far with medical common sense to the exclusion of alternative New Age remedies like chakra cleansing and energy-field realignment" Eddy said he has tried repeatedly to pull Schaffner back from the precipice of lucidity "I admit, science might be great for curing diseases, exploring space, cataloguing the natural phenomena of our world, saving endangered species, extending the human lifespan, and enriching the quality of that life," Eddy said "But at the end of the day, science has nothing to tell us about the human soul, and that's a critical thing Craig is missing I would hate for his soul to be lost forever because of a stubborn doubt over the actual existence and nature of that soul" Gina Hitchens, a lifelong astrology devotee, blamed Schaffner's lack of faith on an accident of birth "Craig can't entirely help himself, being a Gemini," Hitchens said "Geminis are always very skeptical and destined to feel pain throughout life as a result of their closed-mindedness If you try to introduce Craig to anything even remotely made-up, he starts going off about 'evidence this' and 'proof that' If only the poor man were open-minded enough to stop attacking everything with his brain and just once look into his heart, he'd find all the proof he needed But, sadly, he's unable to let even a little bit of imagination drive his core beliefs" Perhaps the person who pities Schaffner most is his brother Frank, a practicing Scientologist since 1991 "It's bad enough when someone has the ignorance to reject Dianetics in spite of its tremendous popularity," Frank said "But Craig isn't even willing to try a free introductory course Scientology has the potential to free humanity from the crippling yoke of common sense, unshackling billions from the chains of century after century of scientific precedent, and yet he still won't give it a try" "I realize that Craig seems very happy with his narrow little common-sense-based worldview," Frank continued, "but when you think of all the widely embraced beliefs that are excluded by that way of thinking, you have to feel kind of sad"  |
