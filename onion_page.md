url for each page:

theonion.com/issue/XXYY four digit number here

Earliest I cuold find was 2813, which correspond to volume and issue

So. get every article on an issue page, add to a structure (write to disk via pickling and name the issue?), and then increment the issue.
if you reach a 404 page, then increment the volume.

if the volume and the issue have both been incremented, stop. you are at the beginning
