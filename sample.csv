|Report: Our High Schools May Not Adequately Prepare Dropouts For Unemployment|,| WASHINGTON, DCA Department of Labor report released Monday finds that America's high schools are not sufficiently preparing emerging dropouts for the demands of unemployment|,|   Future jobless Americans between classes at Oakes High School In a letter introducing the report, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao explained that schools routinely fail to impart dropouts with the critical lying- and sitting-around skills they need to thrive in today's jobless market "Our public high schools place too much focus on preparing kids for professional careers," Chao said "This waste of resources leaves our dropouts, the majority of whom have no chance of ever finding a job, wholly unprepared to sleep till 1 pm, or watch daytime television while eating ramen noodles out of an upturned Frisbee" According to the study, America's weakest academic performers also drop out of high school without ever having learned to steal beer money from their housemates' change jars or wash their hair with bar soap "This oversight cannot continue if our kids are to become unproductive citizens," Chao said "The future dregs of society are not being served" Despite massive cuts in recent decades, some remnants of math and science instruction continue to plague many school districts These courses, Chao argued, waste valuable time and money Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings defended the nation's public-school system "Educators do a lot to ensure that the most hopeless students slip through the cracks," Spellings said "Arbitrary rules, irregularly enforced discipline, and pointless paperwork are just the first things that come to mind"   [pagebreak]  She added: "Easy grading encourages students to be sloppy and late handing in homeworka skill that makes future deadbeats very competitive in stonewalling landlords and bill collectors" Chao said educators need to think outside the classroom and give kids some real off-the-job experience  "Increasing suspensions and expulsions is a good start," Chao said "Furthermore, scoliosis exams should be made more routine, so students learn to adapt to the all-underwear wardrobe typical of the non-working class" Chao also suggested that schools hold more blood drives, which would prepare dropouts for visits to their local blood-plasma donation centers for quick and easy cash  Some educators say the report paints too bleak a picture of schools' efforts to instill students with a lack of ambition "We are doing a terrible, terrible job," said James Dunham, the principal of HS 445 in New York "We literally could not be doing any worse" Dunham highlighted the fact that the hallways of his school are lined with vending machines that sell nothing but unhealthy snack products such as soda and potato chips, both of which acclimate students to the diet of a jobless lowlife Susan French, a spokesperson for the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, said educators are superb role models for the unemployed dropouts of tomorrow Said French: "Students spend seven hours a day surrounded by adults who despise their low-paying jobs If the critics out there know a better way to discourage a young person from entering the work force, I'd like to see it" |
|Suicide Bomber Killed En Route By Car Bomb|,| BAGHDADTerrorist cells in Baghdad are in mourning for suicide bomber Ahmed al-Khalaf, 19, who was killed by a car bomb Monday, 200 yards from an Iraqi police station, his intended target|,|   Sources within the insurgency said al-Khalaf was "on his way to becoming a glorious martyr" when he was struck down by the car-bomb explosion Twenty-three other civilians were also killed  "What kind of God allows the death of people who are on their way to kill innocent people?" insurgent leader Abdulwahid al-Tomizie said "On the one hand, I am elated that the car-bomb explosion was successful, but the loss of the suicide bomber is a tragedy, as is the survival of all the innocent people he might have killed"  According to al-Tomizie, al-Khalaf could have killed as many as 40 innocent people, had his life not been cut short  "It is tragic that al-Khalaf died seven minutes sooner than he intended," said Hassan Abdul Aziz, leader of a local cabal of Sunni separatists "To think that he was just yards from his intended target Our thoughts and prayers are with his terrorist cell" No insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for the car bomb, although as many as 18 separate insurgency factions have vowed to carry on the fight in al-Khalaf's memory In the past week, over 170 Iraqi citizens and US troops have died in terrorist or insurgent attacks, but al-Khalaf's death marks the first time a terrorist has been killed by another terrorist while on a different terrorist mission   Iraqis mourn the car-bombing death of suicide bomber al-Khalaf Terrorist leaders have called the incident a "wake-up call" "No one likes to see a senseless waste of a willingness to take human life," said al-Qaeda operative Salih al-Shimiri, in a videotaped message aired on Al-Jazeera Monday evening "However, there are worse problems than having too many suicide bombers on our streets" Insurgent leaders met Monday to draft new rules to prevent bombing mix-ups like the one that killed al-Khalaf One proposal would limit suicide bombings to odd hours, car bombings to even Another designates "Car Bomb Only" traffic lanes to help terrorists get to their bombing locations more quickly and efficiently "I had a man last week get stuck in traffic while driving a car bomb to the Mendi Temple," al-Shimiri said "When he arrived, he found it already on fire We don't fill the cars up with enough gas to make two-way trips, so he was forced to blow up a nearby disco This is madness" Al-Shimiri added: "We all have the same goal herethe killing of innocent civilians Let's stop working at cross purposes" Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr believes all insurgents must find direction in their extreme fundamentalist faith "When I close my eyes, all I can see are the faces of all the innocents al-Khalaf will never get a chance to kill It is a sad day, but we must not let it shake our faith in the wrath of Allah" |
|White House Denies Existence Of Karl Rove|,| WASHINGTON, DCThe White House denied rumors of wrongdoing by anyone named Karl Rove Monday, saying the alleged deputy chief of staff does not exist|,|   White House press secretary Scott McClellan "To my knowledge, no one by the name of Karl Rove works for this president, his staff, or for that matter, anyone on earth, since he is not a real person," White House press secretary Scott McClellan told reporters Monday Despite White House denials, allegations have surfaced in recent weeks that Karl Rove is the man who leaked covert CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity to the press He is rumored to be President Bush's senior advisor, chief political strategist, architect of the president's 2000 and 2004 election victories, and the current deputy White House chief of staff, as well as a frequent guest on televised political talk shows "None of these allegations are supported by the facts," McClellan said "The opponents of this administration have created a mythical figure in order to discredit the president All they have done is divert attention from the important work at handthe war in Iraq and the war on terror In doing so, they have dishonored the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform" "This time," he added, "the Democrats have gone too far" According to fringe journalist Lou Dubose, author of Boy Genius: Karl Rove, The Brains Behind The Remarkable Political Triumph Of George W Bush, Rove was born Dec 25, 1950 in Denver, CO Dubose alleges that Rove lived in Colorado with his family until 1963, when he moved to Salt Lake City, UT According to Dubose, the shadowy figure entered politics in college, quickly moving through the ranks to become the chairman of the College Republican National Committee at age 22  [pagebreak]  The White House has called such reports "nonsense"   This rare photo depicts the man Bush Administration critics are calling "Karl Rove" McClellan reiterated his denial of Karl Rove's existence 33 times during the press conference When pressed, he distributed a list of "real, actual political figures about whom I'd be happy to comment" The list included only President George W Bush and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y Mineta Rumors of the figure's existence were given a boost early this month when, as part of the official investigation into the CIA leak, a Time magazine reporter named Rove as the source of the leak "This is a very clever fiction concocted by those on the other side of the aisle,"  Vice President Dick Cheney said "It's preposterous at its core" The phantom advisor has come under heavy fire in recent weeks from critics of the administration, who say he should be fired for his role in the scandal President Bush has pledged that anyone in his administration found to be involved in the CIA leak will be dismissed "There is no such organization as the CIA," McClellan said "This is tinfoil-hat stuff" Initially demanding that the alleged Rove be fired, Democrats say they are now focusing their efforts on proving the figure's existence  "I believe this deputy White House chief of staff is real, despite White House claims to the contrary," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said "But to disprove this wild ghost story, we must begin an exhaustive fact-finding mission, for which I pledge all the time and resources of the entire Democratic party" |
|First-Time Novelist Constantly Asking Wife What It's Like To Be A Woman|,| SAN JOSE, CAClaims adjuster and novice author John Kitner is "constantly" asking what it's like to be a woman, reports his wife Becky|,|   Amateur novelist John Kitner struggles to write from a woman's perspective "It never lets up," Becky said "Today he asked, 'If a woman were running from a burning building, what would she be thinking about?' And I don't know how to answer that I'd be thinking about getting away from the building, I think" The questions began when Kitner first started writing his crime thriller, Low Jack, in December of 2004 At the time, he reportedly asked occasional questions ranging from, "Would a woman want to be romanced by 22-year-old wannabe confidence man Ronnie Hodges?" to, "How would a woman feel if she were hammering a guy on the head with a briefcase full of money?" "I didn't mind the questions at first," Becky said "I was happy to help out" But in recent weeks, the level of questioning has become what Becky called "really annoying" Becky said when the two were at the grocery store Sunday night, Kitner began staring at her as she looked over the frozen-foods section According to Becky, Kitner asked, "What type of food would a woman try to eat if she were trapped in a walk-in freezer? How about a piece of liver? Would that be it? If I were a woman, I think that would be just perfect But I don't know You tell me, Becky" Becky said her husband's questions are typically followed by him producing a small notebook and ball-point pen "I really don't like when he whips out the notebook and clicks the pen and stares at me," Becky said According to Kitner, Becky has been "a great resource" in his novel writing  [pagebreak]  "Becky is an indispensable tool in my writer's tool chest," Kitner said "I feel like, with her, I'm able to get under Vivian's skin"  Kitner referred to his heroine, Vivian Drake, a 26-year-old ingenue who is "thrust into a steamy underworld of intrigue and danger in Low Jack" Best-selling writer Tom Clancy, author of Without Remorse, said Kitner is lucky to have Becky as a source of reference "I worked alone in my study for years on The Bear And The Dragon before I realized my female character Lian Ming was dead on the page," Clancy said "If only I'd had someone like Becky around to answer some questions It might have helped me figure out how women think" Clancy said he hopes Kitner can unlock the mystery of writing female characters, something no male novelist has ever been able to do Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and literary critic John Updike agrees "Someone should have thought of asking these questions earlier," Updike said "If only Tolstoy had thought of this, Anna Karenina might have been a more memorable novel" Updike added: "John Kitner's quest is a part of a larger one: how to write a character who is different from yourself If he can find the magic key to this age-old puzzle, he will usher in a renaissance in human literature For the first time, crime novelists will be able to write convincingly about murderers, even if they are not murderers themselves Non-spies will be able to write about spies In this new type of literature, there will actually  be characters who are something other than novelists Imagine the possibilities" Kitner shares these high hopes for his work, but his wife, who has had an opportunity to read some of his early drafts, said it "still needs a lot of work" |
